        <p>This year we visited Amberley Museum and Heritage Centre. 22 members attended along with 2 volunteers, 1 Community Transport driver and 2 members of staff.</p>

        <p>We travelled to and from Amberley by two minibuses, which we hired from Arun Community Transport. We set off at 10am and returned at 5pm. We had a fantastic day out and the weather was brilliant. The objective for the day was firstly to give our members an enjoyable day out and to give their Carers some much-needed respite.</p>

        <p>We arrived at Amberley at 10.45am and met up with other members who had been transported there by their Carers. We split up into 4 groups and visited various attractions including a ride on the train. We had lunch at 1pm. Some members brought their own lunch and others bought lunch in the cafe. After lunch we split up again and visited the remaining attractions including a ride on the open top bus. We met up again at 15.30pm for drinks and ice creams and then visited the gift shop.</p>

        <p>All in all it was a good day out. Many thanks must go to all our fantastic volunteers and our volunteer mini bus driver Steven who generously gave their leisure time, and to all who, in some way or another, made a contribution to the day.</p>

  <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

  <p>This is for the events page, with each section here representing one event.</p>

  <p>You can either:<br />
    <span style="padding-left: 20px">- <strong>Edit an existing event</strong> by changing the fields that are currently on this page</span><br />
    <span style="padding-left: 20px">- <strong>Add a new event</strong> to the bottom of the list by scrolling to the bottom of this page and clicking "Save &amp; Add another", which will result in a new blank set of fields appearing at the bottom of this page that can then be filled in with appropriate text.</span></p>

  <p><strong>You can also delete an event</strong> by clicking the small red delete button to the top right of an event entry.</p>

  <p>The main part of the event article should be placed in the large text box, and you can find various buttons that will allow you formatting options. The editor uses "Markdown", which is basically just using symbols and text to do what a text editor like Word would typically do. You can just highlight text and press the buttons and the Markdown will be added automatically.</p>

  <p><strong>If you want to add an image</strong>:</p>
    <span style="padding-left: 20px">- Position the writing cursor in the text where you want the image to appear</span><br />
    <span style="padding-left: 20px">- Click the little landscape symbol in the line of tools above the text editing area (it will say Picture if you hold your mouse cursor over it for a bit)</span><br />
    <span style="padding-left: 20px">- In the box that appears, click Browse...</span><br />
    <span style="padding-left: 20px">- This will bring up a box that shows your hard drive, now you can navigate to the folder with the desired image, and click Open to upload it.</span><br /><br />

  <p>This will create a line of Markdown that looks something like this: <code>[cms:asset 60]</code>. You can cut and paste this if you want to move it around your writing and reposition it.</p>

  <p>If you want to have multiple images side by side, simply move the above code into the same line with NO SPACE inbetween, so:<br /><code>[cms:asset 60][cms:asset 61]</code>. This should happen automatically if you just put one image in after another without moving the cursor. I recommend having only two images to a line, so:</p>

  <p><code>[cms:asset 60][cms:asset 61]<br />
    [cms:asset 62][cms:asset 63]</code></p>

  <p>Otherwise the layout will start to go wrong!</p>

  <p><strong>If you want to have larger text</strong>, use the H symbol and select between headings 1-6 (1 is largest, 6 is smallest).</p>

  <p><strong>As with everything else in Perch, remember to click Save Changes at the bottom to save your text to the page!</strong></p>
